#ONLINE-SURVEY-SYSTEM
This is a complete begineer project just to get an idea of how different SQL queries can be used.
Created a database named "System" and created multiple tables with specific columns and already exixting data.
You can refer to the Enhanced Entity Relationship Diagram(EER) diagram (EER_Diagram.png) to know in detail.
I considered some random survey with my friends about cartoon characters, toothpaste brands, marvel characters etc and collected data as survey details.
Some inserting and view commands are used to insert the data into tables and to display required information from those tables respectively..
Hope this information helps you to get a brief idea about my project..
Thank you :)
