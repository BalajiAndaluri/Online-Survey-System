This project is a beginner-friendly exercise in using SQL queries. I created a database named "System" with multiple tables containing sample data. The relationship between the tables is illustrated in the EER diagram (EER_Diagram.png).

I conducted a survey among my friends and collegemates about their LeetCode coding experiences and collected the data as a CSV file. Using Python Pandas, I extracted all rows from the CSV file and inserted them into the database tables in MySQL Workbench.

Learning Objectives

  - Gain hands-on experience with SQL queries.
  - Understand how to create and populate database tables.
  - Learn how to import data from CSV files.
  - Explore the use of ER diagrams to visualize database relationships.

Additional Notes

  - This project is a simplified version of a real-world scenario.
  - You can expand on this project by adding more tables, data, and complex queries.
